# Starter Seed for Auth0-React Quickstart Guides

This project contains a regular ReactJS application where react-router is used to require authentication for urls with restricted access.
The library `auth0-lock` provides the user authentication, and we also have a `auth.js` helper to manage the localStorage items.

## Getting Started

Run:

```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# copy configuration (see below)
cp .env.example .env

# Run
npm start
```
